# Recipes App

In this recipes app, i used, along with colleagues, the most modern within the React Ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!

It is possible to: see, search, filter, favorite and follow the progress of preparing food and drink recipes!

The database is 2 different APIs, one for food and one for drinks (TheMealDB & TheCockTailDB).

The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed on smaller screens.
